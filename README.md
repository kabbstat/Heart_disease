## HEART DISEASE PROJECT 
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. 
The goal of the project is to build a predictive model using supervised learning techniques that can classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 14 attributes collected from clinical records of patients.

Age: Age of the patient in years
Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
CP: Chest pain type (4 values)
Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = True, 0 = False)
Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
Exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Ca: Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thal: Thalassemia (3 = Normal, 6 = Fixed defect, 7 = Reversible defect)
Target: The target variable (1 = Heart disease, 0 = No heart disease)
# Models Used
Several machine learning algorithms were tested for this project:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
